"Q: Why are we making a website about dinosaurs?","A: Because everyone loves dinosaurs! And if you hate them, you can console yourself with the fact that they've been extinct for 65 million years."
"Q: The dinosaur I love most isn't on the Dino-site! How do I add it?","A: Good question! If you want to add a new dinosaur, you'll need to edit dinosaurs.csv - you can do it! You're in Informatics! And you don't have stubby little arms like a T-Rex!"
"Q: I told my instructor I understand routes and templates, but I actually have no idea what is happening right now. Am I doomed?","A: First off, you're not extinct and you aren't covered in scales or feathers -- so you're doing great! Today is all about trying to get more comfortable with creating a new route and template in our application. By the time you do this 65 million more times for Project 2, you'll be crushing it at velociraptor speeds."
"Q: Why do I love this class so much?","A: It's almost definitely not because we are piping in happy drugs through the ventilation. It's just because you are a smart human, and making applications in flask is fun!"
